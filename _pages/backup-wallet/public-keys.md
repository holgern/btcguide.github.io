title: Backup Public Keys
---

While you can spend bitcoin with only `m` seeds, you must also have all `n` public keys to be able to spend any bitcoin.
For this reason, we recommend saving **many** copies (each one having *all* public keys).

#### Save to USB Pen Drive or DVD Drive
Make many copies and store in many locations.
We recommend you keep a copy of *all* public keys (and related metadata) with *each* seed.

#### Save on Your Computer
TODO: add instructions on how to save this with Specter.

#### Save Online
Save this data to various cloud providers (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud) or backup services (Mozy, Carbonite, Backblaze, etc) that you may already use.
Keep in mind this now means they have the ability to see all your bitcoin transactions and balance information (if they decide to peek).
