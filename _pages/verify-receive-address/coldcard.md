title: Verify Receive Address on Coldcard
---

As of [Firmware Version 3.2.2](https://coldcardwallet.com/docs/upgrade) (January 14th, 2021) Coldcard's Address Explorer supports multisig, so you can verify (partially redacted) receive addresses while maintaining an airgap!

1. From the main screen, select `Address Explorer`
![](/assets/img/verify-receive-address-coldcard-1.jpg){:width="35%" class="border_image"}

1. Scroll to the bottom of the warning message, then press the indicated number to continue

1. Scroll to the bottom of the options and select the name of your multisig wallet (`btcguide.github.io` in the example):
![](/assets/img/verify-receive-address-coldcard-2.jpg){:width="35%" class="border_image"}

1. Scroll down to verify the (partially redacted) receive address(es)
