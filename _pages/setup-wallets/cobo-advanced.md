#### Verify Your Firmware Before Installing
Confirm that the sha256 hash digest of the file you downloaded matches what is expected:

```
$ shasum -a 256 V1.4.0-BTC_Only.zip 
6956715f43893da00f41ff6e3da5403c908e853f35ad85b80ab75af59b3f1faf  V1.4.0-BTC_Only.zip
```
(This is accurate for `v.1.4.0` but will become stale for future releases. Calculate the hash digest of the new file and confirm that it matches what's published by the company.)

## Not Perfect
No device is perfect and this one is no exception.
