While multisig offers **unparalleled security** (see more in the [Why Multisig](/why-multisig) section), the benefits do not come for free.

Here are some of the current negatives of using any multisig scheme:

* [Added Complexity](/known-issues/complexity)
* [Limited Hardware Wallet Support](/known-issues/hw-vendors)
* [Verifying Receive Addresses](/known-issues/verify-receive-address)
* [Extra Cost](/known-issues/cost)
* [Seeds and Privacy Leaks](/known-issues/seeds-and-privacy)
