While multisig is slightly more expensive, for securing large amounts of bitcoin it's well worth it.
You can see more about recent multisig improvements [here](/why-multisig-advanced).

## More Hardware
Buying multiple hardware wallets is more expensive than buying one.

Fortunately, open-source paper wallet software [like SeedPicker](http://seedpicker.net/) has been released that lets you add seed(s) to your multisig quorum for recovery without having to purchase additional hardware wallets to get started (until/unless you need to perform emergency recovery).


## Higher Transaction Fees
The more signatures in your transaction, the higher your transaction fees.

The good news is that segwit gives a witness discount for `p2wsh` transactions, which has led to them being labelled "[Unfairly Cheap](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/988041430332530688)"!
