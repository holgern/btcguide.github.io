#### Software Wallets Are Dangerous
It's harder to secure a general purpose operating system than to secure a special-purpose hardware product.
SeedPicker pushes more security responsibility onto end users.

Advanced users (those comfortable setting up an airgap machine and verifying SeedPicker's results) love how SeedPicker can trustlessly eliminate [RNG attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator_attack) on your seed phrase.
Regular users are more likely to shoot themselves in the foot and are probably better off trusting their hardware wallets to generate the seed phrases correctly.
